  <h1>Meet Our Grizzly Bears!</h1>
  <h2> Ollie</h2>
  <img src="https://milwaukeezoo.org/wp-content/uploads/NorthAmerica_GrizzlyBear_Ronnie-e1660934793902.jpg" alt="Ollie">
  <p>Ollie is our distinguished grizzly bear resident at The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo. With a striking presence and a shimmering fur coat, Ollie prefers to be cared for with a respectful distance. Despite his captive environment, he thrives in his enriched habitat, enjoying interactions with specially designed toys and engaging in activities that stimulate his natural instincts.</p>
  <h3>
     <p>Special Care</p>
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Enriched Habitat: Ollie's enclosure is designed to mimic natural environments, with ample space to roam and explore. It includes features like climbing structures, pools for swimming, and areas for foraging.</li>
    <li>Nutritious Diet: Ollie's diet is carefully monitored and consists of a balanced mix of fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, and occasionally meat to meet his nutritional needs. </li>
    <li>Veterinary Care: Regular check-ups and health assessments are conducted by our veterinary team to monitor Ollie's physical health and address any medical concerns promptly.</li>
    <li>Behavioral Enrichment: To keep Ollie mentally stimulated, we provide a variety of toys, puzzles, and sensory experiences that encourage natural behaviors such as foraging, climbing, and exploring.</li>
    <li>Visitor Interaction: While Ollie prefers to observe visitors from a distance, educational programs and guided tours allow guests to learn about grizzly bears and the importance of conservation efforts.</li>
