    Meet Wren, the charismatic American alligator who adds a touch of mischief
    and sunlit charm to The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo. Wren delights in basking in
    the sun, often found lounging near the water's edge, her scales shimmering
    in the sunlight. She has a playful streak and enjoys interacting with the
    birds in her habitat, sometimes teasing them with a stealthy approach. In
    her spacious enclosure, Wren thrives on activities that highlight her
    natural behaviors and instincts. She enjoys swimming leisurely in her pool,
    exploring the shallows, and occasionally engaging in playful interactions
    with the avian residents.
