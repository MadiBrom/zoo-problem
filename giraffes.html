    Ollie is our distinguished grizzly bear resident at The Wild Animal
    Mini-Zoo. With a striking presence and a shimmering fur coat, Ollie prefers
    to be cared for with a respectful distance. Despite his captive environment,
    he thrives in his enriched habitat, enjoying interactions with specially
    designed toys and engaging in activities that stimulate his natural
    instincts.

    Meet Mona, the beloved grizzly bear who calls The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo home.
    Mona captivates with her gentle demeanor and playful nature. Unlike Ollie,
    Mona delights in interacting closely with zoo staff, forming bonds that
    enrich her life in captivity. In her enriched habitat, Mona eagerly engages
    with specially designed toys and activities that stimulate her curious
    nature. She enjoys playful interactions with her caretakers, eagerly
    anticipating their visits for enrichment sessions and training exercises.
